## Hi!

I'm Bong, from Ninh Binh, Vietnam but now I'm living in Sydney, Australia. Currently, I work at [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/) as a senior software engineer. Before that, I was a tech lead in [SafetyCulture](https://safetyculture.com/), a lead software engineer in [Grab](https://www.grab.com/sg/), a backend software engineer at TinTin (a fintech startup), and a game developer at Gameloft. Prior to that, I studied at Hanoi University of Engineering and Technology, Vietnam National University and earned a bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

Although my focus is on distributed systems, I'd like to spend some time with different technologies. And in general, I like to write codes to solve problems that have impacts on people's lives.
