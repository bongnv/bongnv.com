# Hi, I'm Bong

I'm from Ninh Binh, Vietnam. Currently I work at Grab as a lead software engineer. Formerly, I was a backend software engineer at TinTin (a fintech startup), and a game developer at Gameloft. Prior to that, I graduated from Hanoi University of Engineering and Technology, Vietnam National University with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

My focus is on distributed systems in [Go](https://golang.org/) programing language. Meanwhile, I'm also interested in frontend technologies for building blogs like my personal one. In general, I like to write codes and to solve problems that have impacts on people's lives.

Beside, here is my wife & me:
